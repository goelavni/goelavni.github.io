<h1>Assignemnt 3</h1>

<p> Struggles: Could not get onmousemove function to work. Was unsure what to put in the javascript file and what to put into the html file.

Success: Explored the onclick option and played around with color sequence when clicking on buttons. </p>


<p> Assignsment 4:

Struggles: Toggling the image of the frog. Could not figure out how to make frog image start off as invisible and toggle between showing and hiding it. I had difficulties saving the js file itself as well. Slightly confused on how to create new files on sublime in a way where the html will always correspond to the created js file. 


Success: Getting the onclick buttin to work for each individual paragraph and have a gradient green effect. Make the show and hide button work so the paragraphs can both become invisible and visible with a button. As for the frog image, at least it disappears when u click the ribbit button. </p>
