    <h1> RECIPE FOR THE BORSCHT</h1>
    
    <p>
      Here is how you make Borscht: Perfect borscht
Serves 4


300g beetroot, peeled

<em>
50g butter
         </em>


1 small onion, 1 small carrot, 1 stick of celery, 1 small leek, all peeled where necessary and cut into small dice or rings

<em>
2 grains allspice
           </em>




½ bay leaf

<em>


1.5l gelatinous beef stock
             </em>




2 medium floury potatoes, eg Maris Piper, peeled and cut into small dice

<em>


½ small cabbage, shredded
               </em>




4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed

<em>


2 tbsp cider vinegar
                 </em>




1 tsp sugar


½ tsp ground black pepper

<em>


Sour cream and fresh dill, to serve
                   </em>


            <br>



      <br>

Cut ¾ of the peeled beetroot into small dice (you may want to wear rubber gloves to do this) and set the rest aside.             <br>

            <br>

Melt the butter in a large pan, and then soften the onion over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.            <br>

            <br>



Add the carrot, leek, celery, diced beetroot, allspice and bay leaf and stir well to coat with butter.             <br>

            <br>

Cook for another 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry.            <br>

            <br>

 Meanwhile, grate the remaining beetroot.            <br>

            <br>



Pour in the rest of the stock and the potatoes and simmer for 15 minutes, then add the cabbage, garlic and grated beetroot.             <br>

            <br>

Cook until all the vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes).            <br>

            <br>



Add the vinegar, sugar, pepper and a pinch of salt and taste.             <br>

            <br>

Add a little more of any of these if necessary, then serve with a dollop of sour cream, a sprig of dill, and some Polish bread on the side.
